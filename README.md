The primary objective of the provided code is to utilize Apache Spark to perform data analysis tasks on a home sales dataset. The dataset contains details about various homes, including their prices, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, etc. Using SparkSQL, the code queries the dataset to answer several specific questions related to average home prices based on various conditions such as the number of bedrooms, the year of sale, the square footage, and view ratings.


This code is setting up and using Apache Spark within a Google Colab notebook environment to process and analyze a dataset about home sales. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

Setting up Spark:

spark_version specifies which version of Spark to use.
os. environment is used to set environment variables to help with Spark setup.
Java and Spark are installed using the apt-get and wget commands.
The tarball for Spark is extracted.
findspark is installed to help integrate PySpark into the notebook.
The paths for Java and Spark are set using environment variables.
findspark.init() initializes the Spark environment.

Start SparkSession:

Libraries necessary to use Spark and load data (SparkSession and SparkFiles) are imported.
A SparkSession is created with the name "SparkSQL".
Load Dataset:

A dataset from an S3 bucket is loaded into a DataFrame named df.
The first few rows of the DataFrame are displayed using df.show().
SQL Queries using Spark:

A temporary view of the DataFrame is created to allow SQL-style queries on the data.
Several SQL queries are executed on the data:
Average price of a 4-bedroom house sold in 2019.
Average price of homes with 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms for each year.
Average price of homes with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, and less than 2,000 sqft living area for each year.
Average price of homes based on the "view" rating, where the homes cost more than $350,000. The runtime for this query is measured and printed out.
